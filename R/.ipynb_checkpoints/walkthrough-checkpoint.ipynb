    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Let N2 be the number of agents in the full network, N1 the number of sample agents from which the researcher will gather ARD, and K the number of ARD questions of the form \"How many of your friends have type k?\" for k = 1, ..., K. Types could be characteristics like gender, race, or other such traits. The goal is to recover the N2 x N1 matrix $M^*$, which gives the linking probability between agents in the N1 sample and agents in the N2 population. \n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher conducts a full census of the network to obtain type data, which, in the example below, is stored in type\\_data.csv, a N2 x K matrix of indicators, where the ik-th entry is an indicator for whether agent i is type k. The ARD data is stored in ARD\\_data.csv, an N1 x K matrix where the ik-th entry is the number of agent i's friends of type k.\n",
